# TryHackMe - Advent of Cyber 2024

I recently completed TryHackMe’s 24-day Cybersecurity Advent Calendar, **Advent of Cyber**. This challenge featured a new Capture The Flag (CTF) exercise for each day of December. It was an incredible experience that provided hands-on exposure to various cybersecurity concepts and industry-standard tools.

## What I Enjoyed Most

One of the highlights was getting my first **reverse shell**! Writing shellcode and using it to gain control of another system was both fascinating and rewarding. The feeling of popping a reverse shell is one I’m sure many cybersecurity professionals can relate to.

Another standout was the **Phishing challenge**, where I used a macro-infused Word document to perform a phishing attack. This was eye-opening, demonstrating how easily these attacks can be set up and executed.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Reverse Engineering**  
   This was challenging due to my limited knowledge of binary structures and interpreting disassembled or decompiled data. Although I managed to complete the tasks with guidance, I plan to do a deep dive into reverse engineering to build confidence in this area.

2. **Active Directory & PowerShell**  
   These were entirely new to me, and I found them both challenging and intriguing. With further research and practice, I’m confident I can become proficient in these areas.

Completing the **Advent of Cyber 2024** was an incredible learning experience that sharpened my technical skills and expanded my understanding of cybersecurity tools and concepts. I’m excited to continue building on this foundation as I progress in my cybersecurity journey!
